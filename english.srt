1
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,870
user experience is the science

2
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,500
have just

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,040
a product like a website or software
application so that it

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,040
easy to use so that it fits the
expectations that the user has for it

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,930
and so that it meeks business schools
there's a whole

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,550
methodology around designing a user
experience in

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,760
sometimes people ask me is it worth it
do

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,949
all that works design a user experience

9
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:45,010
so let's talk about the return on
investment

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,140
or Rooy doing user experience work

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,140
IEEE is set professional organization

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,230
that put out reports and does research
for programmers developers and engineers

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:56,969
and

14
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,520
they put out an article called why
software sales

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,489
here's some interesting data from
article they estimate that the amount of

16
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,399
money that is spent worldwide

17
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:13,149
in information technology is estimated
at $1 trillion dollars a year

18
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:16,180
the percent of projects that are
abandoned

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,490
because they are hopelessly inadequate
is up to fifteen percent

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,500
that's all projects the percentage
revenue that goes to the

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,229
it. create is 5 percent have a company's
total revenue

22
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,890
and up to 10 percent if it's a financial
telecommunications company

23
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,030
the amount of time that programmer spend
on rework that is actually avoidable

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,799
is fifty percent of their time the cost
of fixing an error

25
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,579
after development is a hundred times
that fixing

26
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,270
an air before development up the project
is completed

27
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,290
%uh the top 12 reasons that projects
fail

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,470
three of the top 12 are directly related

29
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,649
to what we would call user experience

30
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,869
user-centered design work and those
three are badly defined

31
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:11,120
requirements poor communication among
customers developers and users

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,480
and stakeholder politics so the kind of
work that

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,260
that user experience professionals do
stakeholder interviews user

34
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,280
researches testing user centered design
these are all things

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,320
that can fix at least three of those
twelve reasons

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,430
why software sales you actually can
calculate the savings

37
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,770
or additional revenue or benefit that
you get from improving the year

38
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,030
user experience and product so let's
look at some

39
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,220
examples to make this more concrete
first example I want to talk about is

40
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,410
let's say that you

41
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,920
are a micro lending company so these are

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,400
of a non-profit organizations that look
for donations from people

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,489
and than a take that money and they
landed out in very small loans

44
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,629
to people around the world who

45
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:05,879
need the money to one a smaller home
business

46
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,800
in order to better their situation so
you have a website

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,750
and people donate money at your website
but the searching and donating part at

48
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,000
the interface that the website is
confusing and hard to use

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,790
and you have estimated that 50 customers
that de

50
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,260
are actually abandoning before donating
because the poor user experience

51
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,090
so let's do some calculations each
customer let's say donates an average of

52
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,099
fifty dollars

53
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:35,709
over the course of the year to you are
losing twenty-five hundred dollars a day

54
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,019
or nineteen twelve thousand five hundred
dollars a year

55
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,489
if you spend fifty thousand dollars to
fix the user experience

56
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,640
issues and another fifty thousand
dollars said to rewrite

57
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,650
the code based on those user experience
improvements

58
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,290
we can estimate you can spend a hundred
thousand dollars improving the user

59
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,200
experience

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,489
it will take you forty days and will
over a month into realized investment

61
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,549
because you've got nine him twelve
thousand

62
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:07,920
five hundred dollars a year that she
could improved

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,519
sale in a little over a month you've
recouped your investment there are many

64
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,659
measurements

65
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:16,950
that would be meaningful for example
conversion rate

66
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,720
that's the number that percent increase
in visitors to a website

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,460
who either by donated or doesn't hurt to
have to do with money it might be they

68
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,890
take the action weapon take like
register

69
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,039
the website where you might be
interested in a decrease in the number

70
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:36,040
a person drop us a little bit and then
the decrease in the number of calls to

71
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,949
the help desk

72
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:41,770
maybe by making use your experience
improvement you can reduce the amount

73
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,320
training that's required for instance if
its internal software application

74
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,790
maybe you wanna increase the usage have
the software application

75
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,280
may be looking to save user time or
maybe you wanna say

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,410
development time perhaps airs

77
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,449
or what's what you are trying to reduce
whatever measure you choose

78
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,150
calculating the return on investment is
a way to show

79
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,680
the value up doing user experience work

80
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,690
she is one of my favorite quotes from
albert Einstein

81
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,710
I think he said it best any intelligent
fool can make things bigger and more

82
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,310
complex

83
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,100
it takes a touch of genius and a lot of
courage

84
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,310
to move in the opposite direction

85
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,259
